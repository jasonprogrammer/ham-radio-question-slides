# Ham Radio Slides

This project is aimed at parsing (a somewhat hand-modified version of) the [Ham Radio Technician question pool](http://ncvec.org/downloads/2014-2018%20Tech%20Pool.txt), and creating Markdown slides from that output. I wrote this code to help generate slides, that I could easily modify, to teach the Technician test material.

There is a JSON file containing some of the question data. Feel free to use it to generate other slides!
